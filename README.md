# GDIM32 In Class Activities

## Week 1

### Activity 1
-All three of us were able to collectively agree on a single piece of us advice that we agreed with: Attend professor and TA office hours.

### Activity 2
-Q1: x = 10

-Q2: x = 2

-Q3: The message "hello world" is printed in the debug area every frame.

-Q4: The ??? should be replaced by Monobehavior

-Q5 & 6: X is being defined as 10 in the Start method. In the following PrintMessage method, the x value is used in the debug. "x =" is used so the debug log outputs "x = 10" rather than just "10".

-Q7 & 8: The final line of code "Transform.Translate(-direction)" is incorrect; "Transform" should be replaced with a gameObject, such as the variable _playerTransform.
